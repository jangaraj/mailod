MAIL SYSTEM NAMES and ADDRESS TYPES

In some places, an identification of other mail systems is used.

One of these is in "The COSINE and Internet X.500 Schema" (section
9.3.18) [RFC1274].  The mail system names listed here are used as the
legal values in that schema under the "otherMailbox" attribute
"mailboxType" type (which must be a PrintableString).

Another place is in "Mapping between X.400(1988) / ISO 10021 and RFC
822" (section 4.2.2) [RFC1327].  The names listed here are used as
the legal values in that schema under the "std-or-address" attribute
"registered-dd-type" type (which must be a "key-string").

Note that key-string = <a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and "-" >.
